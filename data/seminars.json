    "href": "assets/LoRA-One.pdf",
    "date": "Oct 2025",
    "summary": "LoRA-One is a theoretically grounded improvement to the common fine-tuning technique (LoRA), proving that the ideal starting direction for adaptation can be calculated efficiently from just a single, initial gradient step. This \"spectral initialization\" provides a \"perfect blueprint\" allowing models to converge faster, more stably, and achieve significant performance improvements over traditional methods across various benchmarks."
